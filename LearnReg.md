========================================================

Summary
========================================================

The application displays the effect of regression line on
each additon of a new data point. For comparison the older
regression line is also shown to see how the new point 
effects the slope of the regression.


Real world Application
========================================================
The real pitch for this simple application is in classrooms
to teach the young minds about salient points that they 
would observe while playing with the app.

- Initially the regression line jumps a lot for fewer data point
- As data points increase the shifts become gradual
- Large data points are less effected by the outliers
- we could also show how otherwise a linear relationship closely 
 following the majority data gets distorted by out lying points
